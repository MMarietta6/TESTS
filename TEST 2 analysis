In code 1 the structure of the code is better, having the prototypes first, then main function and 
then after there are the functions. This approach enhances code maintainability and reusability.
Code 2 has main in the very end which complicates readabilty.
Code 1 also has avoided using printf and scanf in the main function, instead making a function in the end to complete it. 
Code 1 maintains modularity by separating input handling into a distinct function, while Code 2 integrates it into main.
Code 1 stores all K values into an array, and then writes that array to file. Code 2 immediatelly writes the K values 
to file, without storing them in an array.
